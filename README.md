# Project Overview
 ### Real-time Text Analyzer
 The real-time text analyzer calculates the following metrics dynamically as the user types a paragraph:
1. Number of Characters
2. Number of Words.
3. Number of Sentences
4. Number of Paragraphs
5. Number of Spaces
6. Number of Punctuations

The calculations are updated in real-time as the user modifies the input text.

Word Details UI
The application integrates with the WordsAPI to fetch definitions for entered words. The API response is used to create a visually appealing UI that displays relevant information, such as definition, parts of speech, synonyms, and Antonyms of the entered word. Only the first object from the array in the API response is considered.
